TOP's HTML Foundations final project

This repository will hold my first HTML project, the TOP's project pertaining to HTML Foundations where I will have to apply all the foundations I have learned so far such as Elements and Tags at the most basic level, working with text, the use of lists and finally links and images. It will also serve as a nie introduction to working with Git and GitHub on an actual project.
